The goal of this fork is to demonstrate performance issues with sites like TweetDeck, as well as the F12 Developer Tools, on Windows.

Clone this project, an run to visit TweetDeck. Sign in, and begin using TweetDeck. It shouldn't be long before you identify some of the performance bottlenecks that Muon presently (at the time of this writing) faces on this site (and others like it).

As an example, compare Electron (top) to Muon (bottom) in the images below:
